# Train Tracker
Need to know the current schedule for a train? Check out Train Tracker! Train Tracker uses the fireBase API to keep track of trains

Once you enter the website:

* You will be present a table of current trains.
* Each train will have a name, destination, frequency, next arrival time, and minutes away.
* You can even add your own train and watch it magically update.
